<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! My name is Ibrahim Youssef, and I’m an aspiring software engineer with
  a passion for building impactful, scalable solutions. I recently graduated
  from the University of Toronto with an Honours Bachelor of Science, double
  majoring in Computer Science and Applied Statistics — with High Distinction.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past year, I’ve completed internships at Annaly Capital, adam.ai, and
  DBS Mena, where I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development, AI,
  and clean software architecture. From automating backend systems and
  optimizing SQL performance to developing chatbot applications with LangChain,
  I’ve applied my skills to real-world challenges and delivered measurable
  results.
</p>
<p>
  I’m now looking for a full-time software engineering opportunity where I can
  contribute to meaningful projects, grow alongside talented teams, and continue
  learning every day. Let’s connect!
